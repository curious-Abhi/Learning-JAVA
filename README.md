# Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository! This repository documents my journey of mastering Java, focusing on problem-solving and building a strong foundation in the language.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to track my progress as I learn Java, specifically geared towards improving my problem-solving skills for coding challenges and technical interviews.

## Topics Covered

## Day 1: Introduction to Java
- Set up Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Wrote and ran my first Java program: "Hello, World!"
- Learned about the basic structure of a Java program, data types, and variables.

## Day 2: Upcoming


## How to Use this Repository

This repository serves as a resource for revisiting concepts, code examples, and problem-solving techniques. Each dayâ€™s progress is documented with code examples and explanations of the key concepts.

## Future Plans

As I continue my journey, I will explore more advanced topics and apply what I've learned to solve complex problems on platforms like LeetCode.
