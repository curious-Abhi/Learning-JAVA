# Java Learning - Day 1

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository contains all the code and concepts I learned on Day 1 of my journey to master Java. 

## What I Learned

On Day 1, I focused on understanding the basics of Java. Here's a summary of what I covered:

1. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
    - Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)
    - Setting up an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse/VS Code)

2. **Basic Java Syntax**
    - Structure of a Java program
    - Writing and running the first Java program: "Hello, World!"
  
3. **Java Data Types**
    - Primitive Data Types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
    - Non-Primitive Data Types: `String`, Arrays, Classes
  
4. **Variables and Operators**
    - Declaring and initializing variables
    - Using arithmetic, relational, and logical operators


## Code Examples

### HelloWorld.java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


## Summary
## Day 1: Introduction to Java
- Set up Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Wrote and ran my first Java program: "Hello, World!"
- Learned about the basic structure of a Java program, data types, and variables.
